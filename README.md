## Architecture Overview -

**VEREN** is built as a cloud-native, backend-first deployment platform using a service-oriented architecture:

**API Gateway:** Central entry point for all project and deployment requests.

**Worker Services:** Handle build execution, deployment orchestration, and asynchronous job processing.

**Artifact Storage:** Stores deployment artifacts using cloud storage (S3-compatible).

**Database Layer:** Tracks project metadata, deployment state, and logs.

**Asynchronous Event Flow:** Ensures reliability and observability of deployments across multiple services.
